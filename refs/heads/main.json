The basis for the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the set $\\mathscr{R}=\\{(a,b) : a,b\\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and }a<b\\}$, where $(a,b)$ is an interval. So, the basis for topology on the Double Pointed Reals is defined by the set $\\mathscr{B}=\\{A\\times \\{0,1\\}:A\\in \\mathscr{R}\\}$. More simply, $\\mathscr{B}=\\{(c,d) : c\\in\\mathscr{R},d\\in\\{0,1\\}$, where $(c,d)$ is an ordered pair. In a sense, the Double Pointed Reals Topology is like keeping parallel copies of the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$; one mapped to 0 and one mapped to 1.\nTo prove the set $\\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\{0,1\\}$, we must prove\n$$\\text{ For every } x\\in X \\text{ there exists some } B_n \\text{ such that } x\\in B_n$$\n$$\\text{ If }x\\in B_a \\cap B_b, \\text{ there exists some } B_c \\text{ such that } x\\in B_c\\subset B_a\\cap B_b$$\nSo to prove the first condition, let $x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\times \\{0,1\\}$. This implies $x$ is of the form $(x,0) \\text{ or } (x,1)$. Suppose $x$ is of the form $(x,0)$. Let $A$ be some interval $(a,b)$ that contains $x$. It is obvious that $x$ belongs to the ordered pair $(A,0)$. A similar argument follows for the case when $x$ is of the form $(x,1)$.\nTo prove the second condition, let $x\\in B_1\\cap B_2$. This implies $B_1 \\text{ and } B_2$ have the same component of the set $\\{0,1\\}$.  Furthermore, the first element in the ordered pair of $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both of the form $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ respectively such that $x\\in (a,b) \\text{ and } (c,d)$. Construct a new interval of the form, $(\\text{max}(a,c),\\text{min}(b,d))$. It follows that $x$ is in this interval, and $x$ is in the basic open set $B_3$ with the first element as $(\\text{max}(a,c),\\text{min}(b,d))$ and the second element the same as $B_1$ and $B_2$.
